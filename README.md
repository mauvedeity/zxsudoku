# zxsudoku
This is my attempt at writing a Sudoku game for ZX Spectrum, using
the ZX Basic compiler as the development environment.

The idea is that it'll let you enter a puzzle and then solve
it. 

I expect that there will be commands something like this:

| Key  | Action                 |
|------|------------------------|
|Left  |O                       |
|Right |P                       |
|Up    |Q                       |
|Down  |A                       |
|Num   |Enter number into cell  |
|Space |Clear cell              |
|Z     |Quit                    |

## Language
I'm using the Boriel ZX Basic compiler, of course keeping as
close to ZX Basic as possible.
